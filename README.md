Inspired Thinking Group Website: https://teamitg.com/ <br />

ITG is looking for a visionary Front End Developer, commercially experienced with the desire and drive to produce the very best work possible - yet pragmatic enough to know that deadlines aren't just a suggestion, so you make sure things get done on time too. You are a perfectionist, not one to shy away from contributing new ideas and opinions. Also, you work well within a busy and thriving development team to produce amazing work every time.

## Brief
**Time to complete:** 4 hours <br/>
**Styling:** CSS/ SASS/ SCSS<br/>
**Logic:** TypeScript or Vanilla JavaScript<br/>
**Browser support:** Firefox & Chrome<br/>
**Landing page design:** [Online XD file](https://xd.adobe.com/view/36548cf1-656a-4482-93bb-4d2815569dce-6307/specs/)

**What do you need to do?**<br />
Using the requirements listed above please re-create the [landing page design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/36548cf1-656a-4482-93bb-4d2815569dce-6307/specs/) within the 4 hour time limit. Semantic HTML must be used through-out, based on your selection of the top two checkboxes please hide/ show the opposing field. <br />
**For example:** If "I am a TV/ Broadband account holder" is checked then the form field of "Mobile number" should be hidden. If the user then changes their mind and checks the other checkbox of "I am a Mobile account holder" then the "Mobile number" form field should re-appear and the "Account number" form field should be hidden instead. **Note:** Only one checkbox should be able to be checked at a time.

All visible form fields are required and you shouldn't be able to submit without all fields being filled, you are free to add any style additions you feel would be a welcome addition. Make sure that the form is responsive and still functions on mobile.
